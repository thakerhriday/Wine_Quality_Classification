# Wine_Quality_Classification
The objective of this project is to classify wine quality into three categories: "Not Good," "Average," and "Good" using machine learning classification models. We have used random forest classification.

Wine quality is a critical factor in the wine industry, influencing consumer preferences. The goal of this project is to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties using classification techniques.

The challenge lies in accurately predicting wine quality using machine learning techniques while handling class imbalance, as the majority of wines in the dataset are classified as "Average."
